** Observation **

    Stable from THRESHOLD_ENTITIES = 1.0 -> THRESHOLD_ENTITIES = 2.0 -> THRESHOLD_ENTITIES = 3.0

    Unstable at THRESHOLD_ENTITIES = 4.0
** Charateristic **
    At THRESHOLD_ENTITIES = 3.0, we have ['3','10', '14', '15', '17'] as a group
    At THRESHOLD_ENTITIES = 4.7, we have ['10', '13', '14', '17'] as a group, no more ['3','15']
**  REASON  **
    Inrease threshold -> increase number entities of each group (before removeOverlap)
    -> at some mainID, the algorithm breaks them

        containers:
        <class 'list'>: ['2', '5', '10', '11', '13', '14', '16', '17']
        <class 'list'>: ['2', '5', '11', '16']
        <class 'list'>: ['2', '5', '11', '13', '16']

    -> mainID = 2, ['2', '5', '11', '16'] has lowest KL_Score -> apply algorithms -> 3 groups: ['2', '5', '11', '16'] , ['13'] , -->['10', '13', '14', '17']<--

** Expriments result **
threshold = 1.0 -> 5-11 || 3-15-18
threshold = 2.0 -> 3-14-15-17 || 6-8-12
threshold = 3.0 -> 3-10-14-15-17 || 2-5-11
threshold = 8.0 -> 5-11 || 3-4-6 || --> 1-2 <-- // when threshold = 8, we have '1'
